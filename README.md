# Threat-Hunting-Framework-Mapping
MITRE ATT&amp;CK Hunt Sprint – ATT&amp;CK Navigator-driven queries and detections
Government/Public Sector APT Threat Hunting Project
🏛️ Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive threat hunting analysis focused on Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) targeting the Government/Public Sector. The project follows a structured methodology using the MITRE ATT&CK framework to map adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), visualize overlaps with ATT&CK Navigator, and translate findings into actionable detections and controls aligned with NIST CSF and ISO/IEC 27001 standards.

Project Type: Academic/Security Research
Industry Focus: Government/Public Sector
Framework: MITRE ATT&CK, NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001
Status: Completed (March 2025)

📊 Executive Summary
Government agencies face persistent targeting from sophisticated APT groups motivated by espionage, disruption, and financial gain. This project analyzes 5 key APT groups, maps their TTPs across the attack lifecycle, identifies common attack patterns, and provides actionable security controls to strengthen defensive postures.

Key Findings:
High-Value Targets: National security data, citizen records, critical infrastructure

Primary APTs Analyzed: APT29, APT28, APT10, Lazarus Group, APT41

Common TTPs: Phishing (T1566), Credential Dumping (T1003), Remote Services (T1021)

Critical Overlap: 70% of analyzed APTs use similar post-compromise techniques

Control Alignment: Mapped to NIST CSF and ISO 27001 for practical implementation

├🎯 Project Objectives
